								<h3>Information Security: hardware, OS, networks</h3>
								<p>I have a solid understanding of information security across hardware, operating systems, and networks. I love exploring this domain 
									and building projects with hardware at home with various projects. Since there is not much of a focus on networks and security in my 
									university's curriculum, I have been self-studying this domain and have been learning a lot from it from courses online and external events.</p>

								<p>In todayâ€™s fast-paced environment, maintaining focus and productivity can be a 
									challenge. Focus Coach is a mobile app that addresses this issue by introducing deliberate interruptions 
									when attempting to open distracting applications on your phone. This subtle 
									inconvenience encourages users to think twice about accessing these apps, 
									ultimately reducing distractions and enhancing productivity.</p>

								<p>PetPals is a pet adoption website that allows users to create shelter and seeker accounts. 
									Shelters can add pets to their shelter, and seekers can search for pets and adopt them.
									Users can also receive notifications, and chat with other users.

								<p>PetPals uses React as its frontend framework and Django REST framework in the backend.</p>

								<p>Collaborated with a team of 5 to develop a desktop app that allows users to create and share wishlists.
									This program allows users to search for things on online retailer websites 
									 and add items to a wishlist. The program then updates 
									the prices of the items and notifies the user when an item is below their desired price for
									 the item. Users can also view items in more detail along with their price data gathered
									  over time.</p>

								<p>PseudoNote is a compact, no frills word processor. We have kept support for the 
									most essential features of word processors, such as auto-save, italics and 
									bolding, lists, and image support. The most integral attribute of PseudoNote 
									is that it is compact enough to run on the oldest systems, and is designed 
									for quick note-taking when other features are unnecessary.</p>

								<p>Examples of metrics are total cases, total deaths, and total testing, and examples of policies include the

									the goal to recommend improvements to the Expedia search alrogithm. We used the data to identify trends that 
									users would find more useful, using multiple statistical methods in R. We then presented our findings to 
									Expedia collaborators.</p>

								<p>This is a mod in Java for the card game rogue-like, Slay the Spire. I asked ChatGPT to generate 
									new cards for the mod, as well as the art for the cards. I then implemented the cards into the game.</p>
								</p>
								<p>I made this mod as a hobby, right after the release of ChatGPT's more stable versions to explore the 
									capabilities of the AI. I also wanted to see if I could make a mod for a game, and I found it to be a 
									 fun and rewarding experience. It was also a challenging experience to modify a production-ready game, and 
									it greatly increased my knowledge of programming in Java.</p>

								<h3><a>Nextcloud Home Network</a></h3>

								<p>Since I live in a townhouse with many floors that are small in area, the wifi signal was 
									particularly weak on the 3rd floor and in the basement. I decided to set up a Nextcloud server
									and connect all the devices in the house to it. This allowed me to store all the data in one place,
									and access it from outside the house.
								</p>
								<p>From this project, I learnt a lot about how networks work, and the various components that compose it.
									I also learnt about the security of networks, and how to protect the data that is stored on it.</p>

							<h3><a>Classical Piano</a></h3>
							<p>I am very grateful to have had the opportunity to study classical piano throughout my childhood, 
								and perform at various events and occasions in front of hundreds of people. I hold the following credentials:</p>
							<div class="list">
								<ul>
									<li>ARCT (Associate Diploma, Royal Conservatory of Music)</li>
									<li>ATCL (Associate Diploma, Trinity College Longon)</li>
								</ul>
							</div>
							<p>In studying this my entire life, I truly believe everyone should 
								have the opportunity to learn an art, as it is a way to express oneself and to find beauty in the world.</p>

							<h3><a>The French Language</a></h3>
							<p>I grew up speaking french in elementary school, and I find it to be a uniquely beautiful and elegant language.
								I have also studied it in high school, and I am currently taking a french course in my third year at U of T.</p>

							<h3><a>Mechanical Keyboards</a></h3>
							<p>I love mechanical keyboards! I enjoy every aspect, from the various parts that compose them, to the building,
								assembling, and modification of them. I have built and modified around 20 keyboards, and I love to give them
								as gifts to friends and family. The big brands like Logitech and Corsair charge a huge markup for their logo,
								and it's much cheaper to build a great board from parts found on sites like Aliexpress. 
								I'm part of a larger community of keyboard enthusiasts that also love
								tinkering with keyboards to personalize them to the right sound, feel, and aesthetic.</p>
